    Every View has Model property which give us access to the Model we pass to it in the Controller.

    The type of the Model is dynamic, is not a 'Movie', so if I use Model. I won't be able to access the Name property.
    So, on the top of the file, we need to use a directive to specify the type of the Model for this View.

    Type @model and we specify the fully qualified name of our Model Class
    Name of the app - Vidly.Models.Movie

    @model Vidly.Models.Movie - The full namespace.

    Now we can add to the h2 the property Name
